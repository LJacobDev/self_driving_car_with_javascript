This repository is the outcome of following a tutorial offered by FreeCodeCamp, called "Self Driving Car With JavaScript"

Tutorial link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI

The objective was to make a rectangle 'self driving car' that could make its way through traffic, using a simple neural network for decision making.

The program is made in JavaScript with no additional libraries used.

The controls for the car speed, number of cars, and mutation rate are kept and adjusted in the code of main.js

It starts off with randomly initialized networks, and then you can save the network that goes the furthest.
Then refreshing the browser will reload that saved network and will randomly mutate new ones based off it in order to try to arrive at networks that can steer successfully to the end of the traffic area.
